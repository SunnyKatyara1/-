        <p>I am a distinguished alumnus of the Italian Institute of Technology, holding a PhD in Applied AI and Robotics. With foundational degrees in Electrical Engineering (Bachelor's) and Control Systems (Master's) completed in 2014 and 2018 respectively, my academic journey has been rigorous and fruitful. Following my post-graduate studies, I embarked on a teaching career at Sukkur IBA University as a Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering. My courses spanned IoT, Controls, and Smart Systems, leveraging my expertise to mold the next generation of engineers.

During my doctoral studies, I pioneered novel frameworks such as Kernelized Synergies and Intuitive Stack-of-Tasks, which have contributed significantly to the field. Since 2022, I have been serving as a Senior Engineer at IMR, Ireland, where my responsibilities encompass supervising field engineering and crafting bespoke solutions for the manufacturing industry using collaborative robotics and Safe AI. My notable projects at IMR include ACROBA, CoreSense, Variational-Grasping, and ACCESS.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I am an Associate Editor for the journal Biomimetic Intelligence and Robotics and an Invited Editor for Robotics at MDPI. I also contribute as an active reviewer for top-tier journals and conferences such as ICRA, IROS, IEEE RAL, IEEE RAM, and IEEE TRO, among others.

My research interests are positioned at the cutting edge of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Human-Robot Collaboration, Learning from Demonstration, and Active Perception. Periodically, I serve as a visiting lecturer, recently teaching a course on Robotics Sensors and Actuators to final-year students at the University of Maynooth.

I am the founder of an early-stage startup, IndusBrain, which is dedicated to developing dependable solutions combining Robotics and AI for Agricultural and Medical applications. I aspire to either join leading teams like Google DeepMind or to foster innovation through my company supported by public-private partnerships.
